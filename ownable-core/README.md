# Core traits and types for the ownable crate

Please see the [ownable](https://docs.rs/ownable) crate for a more comprehensive overview.

This crate contains the core types and traits used by `ownable` available without all of the
macro related dependencies that get used for the derive macros. If you don't rely on the derive
macros then you may benefit from pulling in fewer dependencies by relying directly on
`ownable-core`.
